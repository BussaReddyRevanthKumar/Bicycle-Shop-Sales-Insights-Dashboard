 ## Process:
- Data Collection:
  Gather sales data from different sources (Excel files, databases, etc.) for the years 2021 and 2022, including sales, profit, units sold, customer details, product data, and country- 
  wise sales.

- Data Cleaning & Preparation:
  Clean the data by removing errors, duplicates, and formatting issues. Organize the data into clear tables for analysis.

- Create Pivot Tables & Charts:
  Use Excel PivotTables and charts (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs) to summarize and visualize key metrics like total sales, profit, units sold, and segment breakdowns.

- Design the Dashboard Layout:
  Arrange visual elements logically—KPIs at the top, trends over time in the middle, and breakdowns (by customer, product, country) at the bottom. Use slicers for Year and Month filters.

- Add Interactivity:
  Include slicers and drop-downs for easy filtering by Year, Month, Product, and Customer segments.

- Finalization & Review:
  Format charts, adjust colors, add data labels, and ensure clarity. Review the dashboard for accuracy and completeness.
