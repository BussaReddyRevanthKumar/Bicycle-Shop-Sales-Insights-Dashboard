# Bicycle-Shop-Sales-Insights-Dashboard
## Project Objective: 
The Bicycle Shop Sales Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the business's sales performance across various dimensions. This dashboard leverages data from 2021 and 2022, offering insights into total sales, profit, profit percentage, units sold, customer segmentation, and country-wise distribution. By visualizing key metrics such as sales trends over months, product performance, and customer contributions, the dashboard serves as a central tool for decision-making, helping stakeholders identify growth opportunities and address challenges effectively.

 ## Process
- Data Collection:
  Gather sales data from different sources (Excel files, databases, etc.) for the years 2021 and 2022, including sales, profit, units sold, customer details, product data, and country- 
  wise sales.

- Data Cleaning & Preparation:
  Clean the data by removing errors, duplicates, and formatting issues. Organize the data into clear tables for analysis.

- Create Pivot Tables & Charts:
  Use Excel PivotTables and charts (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs) to summarize and visualize key metrics like total sales, profit, units sold, and segment breakdowns.

- Design the Dashboard Layout:
  Arrange visual elements logicallyâ€”KPIs at the top, trends over time in the middle, and breakdowns (by customer, product, country) at the bottom. Use slicers for Year and Month filters.

- Add Interactivity:
  Include slicers and drop-downs for easy filtering by Year, Month, Product, and Customer segments.

- Finalization & Review:
  Format charts, adjust colors, add data labels, and ensure clarity. Review the dashboard for accuracy and completeness.
